# Overview  

This Jupyter Notebook implements an automated **Facebook Viewbot**, designed to simulate and generate artificial views for Facebook posts. This project is for **educational purposes only**, such as understanding automation techniques, scripting workflows, or ethical discussions about digital engagement practices.  

## Objectives  

- Automate the process of simulating views on Facebook posts.  
- Showcase Python's capability for browser automation using tools like `selenium`.  
- Provide a practical example of automation workflows with a focus on ethical implications.  

## Features  

- **Browser Automation**: Uses tools like `selenium` for automating interactions with Facebook's web interface.  
- **View Simulation**: Executes scripted actions to mimic user behaviors such as scrolling and viewing posts.  
- **Customization**: Adjustable parameters for the number of views, speed, and target posts.  

## Prerequisites  

- Python 3.x installed on your system.  
- Install required Python libraries:  
  ```bash  
  pip install selenium  

**WebDriver**: Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome). Ensure it's added to your system PATH.

### For Chrome:
Ensure you have:

1. **Google Chrome** installed on your system.
2. The compatible **ChromeDriver** for Selenium. [Download ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver).
3. Add ChromeDriver to your system PATH or specify its location in the script.
